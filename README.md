# Overview
This software helps the user navigate a list of recipes and easily see what instructions and ingredients are necessary.

This program is hoped to help resolve the issue of having difficulty browsing a recipe website, with thier constand adds and lagging, we thought that having the recipes in a text only based format would help to solve the commonly faced frustration.

# Development Environment
We used the Community Version of IntelliJ IDEA. It was a great interface to code in, we learned a lot through trial and error as things often end up in the coding sphere of projects.
We were originally going to have the recipes data stored through JSON files but we ran into roadblocks when the build would not allow for JSON conversion. Because of that we became very familiar with Kotlin lists and data classes

# Useful Websites
- JetBrains was great to help set up the enviornment https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-your-first-kotlin-app.html
- Kotlinlang helped with learning the syntax https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html

# Future Work
- Allow for uploading recipes and storing them
- Menu option to export a file with ingredients
- Create a GUI
